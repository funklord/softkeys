 * sk_keyboard -- the keyboard this app draws itself (project.md
 * sec 6.2).
 *
 * Sec 6.2 planned a key ROW: a strip of Ctrl, Esc, Tab and arrows above
 * whatever keyboard Android supplies, because Android's own keyboards
 * expose none of those. That answers the right question on a device where
 * a system keyboard appears. Where none does, the row is a strip of
 * modifiers with nothing to modify, and the terminal cannot be typed into
 * at all.
 *
 * So this is the other half rather than a replacement, and which one is
 * shown is a device-level setting (sec 10.6). The row still exists,
 * unchanged, for people whose system keyboard works and who want its
 * prediction, its languages and its layout.
 *
 * Every key goes through bssh_input_router, exactly as the row's do: one
 * translation path for physical keys, both on-screen keyboards and paste
 * (sec 6.3), or they drift apart.
