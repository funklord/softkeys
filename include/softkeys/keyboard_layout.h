/*
 * soft_keyboard_layout -- what the built-in keyboard holds
 * (project.md sec 6.2).
 *
 * sec 6.2 asked whether to ship a keyboard of our own and answered
 * "probably no for v1, rely on the key row plus external keyboards". The
 * holder has since answered it the other way, and the reason is the one
 * the section could not have known when it was written: on a phone with
 * no physical keyboard the key row is a strip of modifiers above a system
 * keyboard that is not there, which is a terminal you cannot type into at
 * all.
 *
 * The KEYS are sk_key_t, deliberately, and not a second struct with the
 * same fields. Both on-screen surfaces are answering one question -- what
 * does this button do when a thumb lands on it -- and a terminal that
 * grew two vocabularies for that would get two answers to "what does Ctrl
 * do", which is exactly the drift bssh_input_router exists to prevent one
 * layer down (sec 6.3).
 *
 * What is added here is the two things a row does not have: keys arranged
 * in ROWS rather than one strip, and a way to reach the other groups.
 */

/*
 * One page of the keyboard: letters, digits and symbols, or the terminal
 * keys a shell needs.
 *
 * Groups rather than one enormous grid, because a phone has room for
 * about forty keys at a size a thumb can hit and a terminal wants well
 * over a hundred. Which forty is the only real decision, and it is made
 * per group: the letters group is what you type prose and commands with,
 * and the others are one tap away.
 */
/*
 * Every row of every group is exactly this wide, in half-key columns.
 *
 * Half-columns rather than whole keys, because a QWERTY row of ten and a
 * bottom row of six cannot share a column grid otherwise -- and the
 * alternative, a separate layout per row, gives up the one thing a grid
 * is for: a key in the same place from one row to the next. Ten letters
 * at span 2 fill it, and so do six wider keys at 3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3.
